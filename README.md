# About me

Hello! My name is Darya Petrashka. I work as a Data Scientist at itransition. I am passionate about data and its usage for problem-solving. 
As for now, I am working on a pharmaceutical project. I'm also into eco projects.
My area of interest includes classical ML and NLP, as well as working with AWS services. 
I never stop learning by taking part in online schools, courses, and workshops. Besides, I like to challenge myself in hackathons.
